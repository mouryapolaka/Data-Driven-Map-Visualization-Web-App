# Data-Driven-Map-Visualization-Web-App
During 2019 - 2020 summer season in Australia, aka the bush fire season, 46 million acres of land was burnt, 5900 buildings were destroyed and about 3 billion terrestrial animals and 34 people died in these wild fires. This had a huge impact on the Australian economy and the wild life.

The goal of this web-based application is to understand the spread of bushfires across different regions, based on the corrdinates and time-series data, by generating map visualisations.

# Frameworks
* Flask
* Folium
* Pandas

## Instructions
* This platform accepts CSV data as input to generate map visualisations.
* The map visualisation funtion for the Bushfire spread takes in a dataset with 3 columns; latitude, longitude and date (format - dd/mm/yyyy). This function generates a time-series heat-map generated by Folium.
* The plot-coordinates function takes in latitude, longitude, location (name of the place) and generates a map with marker plots.
* The temperature function takes in the name of the state, average temperature and date (format - dd/mm/yyyy) to generate a Choropleth map time-series map.(Note: this function is still under development)
