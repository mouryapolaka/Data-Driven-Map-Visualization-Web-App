# Data-Driven-Map-Visualization-Web-App
During 2019 - 2020 summer season in Australia, aka the bush fire season, 46 million acres of land was burnt, 5900 buildings were destroyed and about 3 billion terrestrial animals and 34 people died in these wild fires. This had a huge impact on the Australian economy and the wild life.

The goal of this web-based application is to understand the spread of bushfires across different regions, based on the corrdinates and time-series data, by generating map visualisations.
